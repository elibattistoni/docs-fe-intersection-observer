# react-custom-animations

This repo contains several folders, where each folder considers a specific animation/transition topic. Each folder has several subfolders, which may be vanilla JavaScript examples (to study in depth the topic), and one or more folders with independent React projects created with `create-react-app`. The React projects are created in order to implement a specific animation or transition feature. The aim is to write these animations without relying on external packages which tend to increase the project's size, therefore using only CSS and JavaScript and the browser APIs.

Since I am writing this before actually starting to code, if in a project I did not succeed in not using an external React package, in the README.md of that project I will mention the library that I used and why.
